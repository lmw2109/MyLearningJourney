    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook showcases my implementation of a Binary Search Tree! \n",
    "\n",
    "For this I use a very simple csv that contains the top 25 highest grossing movies world wide as of june 2022!\n",
    "\n",
    "For a closer look at the Code check out 'bst.py'!\n",

    "#### Definition of a Binary Serach Tree\n",
    "- A Binary Search Tree has a root\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each node can have up to 2 children\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each node holds a key that is\n",
    "\n",
    "- less than any key in its right subtree\n",
    "\n",
    "- greater than any key in its left subtree\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Features for the time being are:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main features**\n",
    "- Insertion: Inserts a node into the BST\n",
    "\n",
    "- Search: Finds and returns a node in the BST\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deletion: Deletes a node from the BST\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional features**\n",
    "- In-order-traversal: Returns all of the nodes in the BST in an ascending order\n",
    "\n",
    "- Maximum/Minimum: Returns the node with the max/min key\n",
    "\n",
    "- Height: Return the height of the BST (or a subtree)\n",
    "---\n",
    "#### Time complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Worst time complexity:** $O(n)$\n",
    "> Worst time complexity occurs when the hight is equal to the amount of nodes in the tree $h = n$. \n",
    "\n",
    "> This essentially means our tree is functioning as a linked-list! (In the worst case: For a node to be inserted, found or deleted the algorithm would have to traverse every node in this 'tree'. This is consideration is especially important when inserting a list of already sorted nodes! A naive method to avoid this is to shuffle the data randomly. More sophisticated solutions are self-balancing trees such as AVL-Trees or R&B Trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Average time complexity:** $O(\\log n)$\n",
    "> Average time complexity depends on the height of the tree which is expected to be $h = \\log n$ in the average case.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Notice:* Time complexity depends on the hight of the tree. It is how the hight is bound that determines worst case complexity.\n",
